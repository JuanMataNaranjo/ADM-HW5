The structure of the homework is the following:

- **main.ipynb:** Notebook in which all results are explained and exposed in a structured and detailed manner.
- **\scripts:** Folder in which the raw python code is stored. Two seperate files can be found in this folder:
    1. *functionality.py:* This file contains all relevant functions for the data pre-processing part (read csv and convert into dictionary, save json files, etc.)
    2. *graph.py:* We have implemented our own Graph class from scratch and have included all relevant methods required for the homework in this .py file.


NOTES: 

- in order to run the notebook, we assume that the required files are held into a **\data** folder.
